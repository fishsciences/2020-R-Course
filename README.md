# Introduction to Programming in R

Materials for Summer 2020 Course taught by Myfanwy Johnston for Cramer Fish Sciences.

#### This course has two primary emphases: programming (i.e., preparation in writing your own functions), and plotting (specifically: visualization with ggplot2).

In service of that, we go a bit more in-depth on language fundamentals and function-writing than most beginner R courses.

Course videos are posted here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOj5McD9FWIwhPoZ-AKBUl-zrP_CZKtnm

Weekly materials are found in the /docs subdirectories.


## Weekly Topics and Exercises

### Week 1: Installation and File Navigation from R

No formal exercises this week - just download and install RStudio, and watch the file navigation videos.  I encourage you to try to mimic some of the navigation from your own computer.

### Week 2: Scripting; Data types and vectors

Scripting: As shown in this week's [first video](https://youtu.be/R8CvvIiuV0I), download the zipped [course repository](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course), unzip it, and open the RStudio project file.  Then run the `sea_mammal_EDA.R` script on your own machine.  Hint: you may need to install the two required libraries; see the code at the end of the video (~22:40) for help on that.

Vectors and data types: download the `vectors.R` script from the R/ folder, and work through it in RStudio.  The script will prompt you to try things on your own - a solution script will be posted after office hours next week.


### Week 3: Lists and logicals; manipulating data frames

Watch this week's [first video](https://youtu.be/2ynMVYad2HI), and work through the [`lists_and_logicals.R` script](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/8a12c753a34f36cc8c2a103f672a514b5c97f157/R/lists_and_logicals.R) along with it.

Watch this week's [second video](https://youtu.be/8X_ljnlcxtI) and follow along or work through the [accompanying script](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/master/R/working_with_dataframes.R).

Reading: [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).

### Week 4: Plotting tidy data with ggplot2

Reading: [Chapter 1](https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html) and [Chapter 2](https://ggplot2-book.org/getting-started.html) of Dr. Hadley Wickham's _ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis_ book.

Optional: work through the [factors script](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/a9e54f5cf8aa173e67df34406b65ee51ede00fb1/R/factors.R) on your own.


### Week 5: Intro to functional programming


### Week 6: Good practices in R; workflow, testing
