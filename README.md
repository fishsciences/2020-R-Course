## Weekly Exercises

### Week 1:

No formal exercises this week - just download and install RStudio, and watch the file navigation videos.  I encourage you to try to mimic some of the navigation from your own computer.

### Week 2:

Scripting: As shown in this week's [first video](https://youtu.be/R8CvvIiuV0I), download the zipped [course repository](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course), unzip it, and open the RStudio project file.  Then run the `sea_mammal_EDA.R` script on your own machine.  Hint: you may need to install the two required libraries; see the code at the end of the video (~22:40) for help on that.
