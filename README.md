# Introduction to Programming in R

Materials for Summer 2020 Course taught by Myfanwy Johnston and Matt Espe for Cramer Fish Sciences.

#### This course has two primary emphases: programming (i.e., preparation in writing your own functions), and plotting (specifically: visualization with ggplot2).

Course videos are posted here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOj5McD9FWIwhPoZ-AKBUl-zrP_CZKtnm

Weekly materials are found in the /docs subdirectories of this repository.


## Weekly Topics and Exercises

### Week 1: Installation and File Navigation from R

Videos: [Installing R and RStudio](https://youtu.be/-mRDE3_j_ho), and [File Navigation in RStudio](https://youtu.be/CWQPX3NOtqM).

Reading: [Good Practices in R](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/master/docs/Week1/Good_practices_R.pdf), and [Ihaka & Gentleman 1996](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/master/docs/Week1/Ihaka_and_Gentleman_1996.pdf).  It's okay if you don't understand much of the paper; the exposure to the concepts and vocabulary alone will help you later.

No formal exercises this week - just download and install R and RStudio, and watch the file navigation videos.  I encourage you to try to mimic some of the navigation from your own computer.



### Week 2: Scripting; Data types and vectors

Videos: [Intro to Scripting in R](https://youtu.be/R8CvvIiuV0I), and [Data Types and Vectors](https://youtu.be/LHZ7tBNE6B4).

Scripting exercise: Download the zipped [course repository](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course), unzip it, and open the RStudio project file.  Then run the `sea_mammal_EDA.R` script on your own machine.  Hint: you may need to install the two required libraries; see the code at the end of the video (~22:40) for help on that.

Vectors and data types exercise: download the `vectors.R` script from the R/ folder, and work through it in RStudio.  The script will prompt you to try things on your own.


### Week 3: Lists and logicals; manipulating data frames

Watch this week's [first video](https://youtu.be/2ynMVYad2HI), and work through the [`lists_and_logicals.R` script](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/8a12c753a34f36cc8c2a103f672a514b5c97f157/R/lists_and_logicals.R) along with it.

Watch this week's [second video](https://youtu.be/8X_ljnlcxtI) and follow along or work through the [accompanying script](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/master/R/working_with_dataframes.R).

Reading: [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).

### Week 4: Plotting tidy data with ggplot2

Watch this week's [ggplot2 part I video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq2g5qNsoiQ) and follow along with the [`ggplot2_part1.R` script](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/master/R/ggplot2_part1.R).  Do the exercises in the script marked "On Your Own".

Reading: [Chapter 1](https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html) and [Chapter 2](https://ggplot2-book.org/getting-started.html) of Dr. Hadley Wickham's _ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis_ book.

Optional: work through the [factors script](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/a9e54f5cf8aa173e67df34406b65ee51ede00fb1/R/factors.R) on your own.


### Week 5: Visualization with ggplot2 part II, and elementary function writing

ggplot2 Part II [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xfJNM0aMfQ) and [lecture slides](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/master/docs/Week5/Intro_to_ggplot2_part2_slides.pdf)

Reading: [Chapters ten](https://ggplot2-book.org/mastery.html), [eleven](https://ggplot2-book.org/layers.html), and [twelve](https://ggplot2-book.org/scales.html) of the ggplot2 book.

Work through the [ggplot2 part II R script](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/master/R/ggplot2_part2.R).


### Week 6: Scripting case studies: functions to summarize data, and advanced visualization.

Complete the Week 6 [scripting assignment](https://github.com/fishsciences/2020-R-Course/blob/master/R/Week6_assignment.R).
